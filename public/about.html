<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Stanley Gracia, a passionate and driven developer with a love for creating intuitive, user-centric solutions. My journey into programming started with curiosity, and over time, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, SQL, and woking with databases, tackling everything from web development to software applications.
</p>

<p>I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn new tools, frameworks, and best practices. Whether it's building sleek front-end designs or optimizing back-end functionality, I’m committed to writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you’ll find me experimenting with new tech trends, collaborating with other developers, or contributing to open-source projects. My goal is to create digital experiences that make a positive impact while continuously improving my craft.

  Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat about technology!</p>
